			<h1>Buying with Home Towne Real Estate</h1>
			<br/>
			<p>Becoming a homeowner comes with a lot of rewards, as well as added responsibility. 
			Deciding to make such an important purchase is specific to your lifestyle.
			Here are some benefits and considerations you should discuss with your Loan Officer
			before you begin the buying process.</p>
			
			<h2>Benefits of homeownership:</h2>
			
			<br/>
			
			<ul>
				<li><span class = "bold">Build Wealth</span> Although home value may increase or decrease short term,
					if you decide to stay in your home long term, it could gradually increase
					in value. This would provide you with a significant return on your investment.
				</li>
				
				<br/>
				
				<li><span class = "bold">Build Equity</span> Equity is the amount of money your house is worth minus what you
					still owe. Every time you make a mortgage payment, the amount you owe reduces and
					increases overall equity. This is beneficial, because equity can be accessed and
					converted to cash.
				</li>
				
				<br/>
				
				<li><span class = "bold">Tax Deductions</span> As a home owner, your mortgage interest and property tax payments
					may be deductible from your federal taxes and possibly state taxes.
					*Consult a tax professional for more information.*
				</li>
				
				<br/>
				
				<li><span class = "bold">Strengthen Credit History</span> Making monthly loan payments is evidence that you are
					a responsible borrower, which builds your credit history. This will help you take out
					loans for other purchases, such as a car or even home renovations.
				</li>
				
				<br/>
				
				<li><span class = "bold">Create the Home You Want</span> Owning a home gives you the freedom to create your dream
					living environment. Whether you want to update appliances, paint rooms, landscape a
					yard, own pets. You will have a house that is completely yours to customize and renovate.
				</li>
			</ul>
